# README
Sample PHP code demonstrating how to use the PayFabric REST API. Each
file is a self-contained, executable example that demonstrates how to perform
a certain task (create a transaction, process a transaction, etc.). 

Note that each of the samples contain significant amounts of hard-coded data. If
you want to try out the samples yourself, you will need to replace the hard-coded
data with your own.
